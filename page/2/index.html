<span><p>‘The Glass is Falling&rsquo; is a game, well more mini-game, that I&rsquo;ve been working on in the background for the last week. The goal of the game is simple, stop the glass from hitting the floor. It&rsquo;s available now on the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=115103698&searchtext=">GM:S Steam Workshop</a>, so if you want to have a play before reading on go ahead!</p><p><img src=http://derme.coffee/uploads/2012/12/r10_22-12-12.png alt="Glass is Falling - Title Screen"></p><p>It was the first game that I designed & planned before I started development and I was extremely happy when the final product turned out like the concept art.</p><p><img src=http://derme.coffee/uploads/2012/12/MockUp.png alt="Glass is Falling - Concept Art">

<span>Portal would have to be one of my favourite puzzle games of all time the others being Lemmings and Portal 2.
When Velociraptor proofing my place of dwelling, something I always wanted to include was a couple of Portal turrets, so I&rsquo;m really hoping that Valve plan to start selling them on the adjacent self to the Weighted Companion Cubes.</span></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=/posts/2012-09-15-day-one-nexus-7/>Day One: Nexus 7</a></span>

<span><p>I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of Minecraft, and I probably will never be, which is a little bit strange seeing as I run a Minecraft server. The game just never clicked for me, I always found it a bit, dull. Though I will admit I&rsquo;m a little bit jealous when people go out and build some incredible stuff like a 8-bit computer or a 3d printer.</p><p><img src=/uploads/2011/10/Minecraft_Destiny.png alt="Minecraft Stargate Destiny">

<span class=item__date>Aug 2, 2011</span>
<span>Recently I went on an adventure to buy a domain name, rent a server and build my own website. After being with free hosting for the last couple of years, I was fed up with the MySQL database outages and DoS attacks on the servers. So it was finally time to move up to paid hosting. If you ever do want to have a crack at making your own website with a budget of $0 the best hosts/domains from my experience were;</span>

<span class=item__date>Jun 13, 2011</span>
<span>When I first discovered the world of programming I wanted to go and make the next Battlefield or Age of Empires, just like the “Getting Started” tutorial warns you against. (Yeah if you missed it, it&rsquo;s right at the top, under the Getting Started heading.)
After failing at that, I lowered my goals to a 2D RTS and a Retro Scrolling Shooter. I still haven&rsquo;t finished either of them. This time it wasn&rsquo;t due to my programming skills, it was because I still hadn&rsquo;t got that message in the “Getting Started” tutorial I had read all those aeons ago.</span>

<span class=item__date>May 16, 2011</span>
<span>NAL the creator of Mmm and MADDENING for iPhone recently released his newest title Innoqous 4 on PC. It&rsquo;s his first title in 3D and makes Innoquous 4 the best in the gravity-flipping series.
The first thing you&rsquo;ll probably notice is that it is his best looking game yet. Previous NAL games have focused on game play rather than graphics in the past. It also has a very nice soundtrack that blends nicely into the game play.</span>

<span class=item__date>Apr 16, 2011</span>
<span><p>GameMaker 8.1 (Single word now) has received mixed reviews on the <a href=http://gmc.yoyogames.com/>Game Maker Community</a>, while a lot of members have given it thumbs up, many are upset that it has broken their code and is not compatible with certain extensions/DLLs. Personally though not only does it run all my games perfectly, it also runs them <em>a lot</em> faster than Game Maker 8.0 (Two Words).</p><p><a href=http://www.yoyogames.com/>YoYo Games</a> made lots of noise about the new zoom feature in the room editor, while this is great (bit buggy though), the big thing new feature for me has to be the upgraded font rendering! Now all my games have sharp as crystal text. When Mike Dailly first brought up the whole font improvement, I just didn&rsquo;t get it, I couldn&rsquo;t even tell the difference between the two images he put up comparing the new and the old. But now I get it and I am going to rush out and buy the standard edition tomorrow (Literally).</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=/posts/2011-04-16-game-maker-8-1-lite-2/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=/posts/2011-04-14-howdy/>Howdy!</a></span>

<span>Its been a while, hasn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ve tried to do a blog a few times now, but haven&rsquo;t been able to keep it going. So here goes attempt three!
Alright, onto the good stuff, other than this blog I&rsquo;ve been busy working on a very cool new game. It&rsquo;s still early days, but it&rsquo;s shaping up to be interesting.
Currently in the process of increasing the graphics quality, something that was severely lacking in the last game.</span>

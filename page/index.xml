I&amp;rsquo;m Chris, I enjoy Coffee, Stargate and anything that can break the speed of light.
My passion is in Engineering where I have Bachelor of Engineering. I majored in Robotics and Mechatronics and graduated with Honours.
In the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve published a few games, helped build open-source software and run a local film festival. Along the way, I&amp;rsquo;ve built flying robots and CnC Machines.
I use my spare time to read, experiment with code and look after my aquatic snail Timmy.</description></item></channel></rss>

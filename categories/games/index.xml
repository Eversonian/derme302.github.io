At this stage I'm not planning on releasing a HTML5 version, though it certainly is a possibility for the future.
        When updating the game I thought that by using the existing codebase I wrote last year would help save time, which in hindsight was a mistake.</description></item><item><title>The Glass is Falling - Update 1.1</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2013-01-22-the-glass-is-falling-update-1-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2013 05:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2013-01-22-the-glass-is-falling-update-1-1/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->

The goal of the game is simple, stop the glass from hitting the floor.

&lt;p>It was the first game that I designed &amp;amp; planned before I started development and I was extremely happy when the final product turned out like the concept art.&lt;/p>

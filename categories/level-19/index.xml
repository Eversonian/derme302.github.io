When I played the original Homeworld in 1999 I loved it, even though I could never get past the 6thmission at the time, it’s a game that’s stuck with me since.
This game with the new engine is simply stunning. The visuals are incredible, the cut scenes are re-mastered and the sound quality is excellent.</description></item><item><title>Level 19 - Chickens and Moles</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2013-03-05-level-19-chickens-and-moles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2013 23:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2013-03-05-level-19-chickens-and-moles/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Level 19 - Innoquous 4</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2011-05-16-level-19-innoquous-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2011 09:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2011-05-16-level-19-innoquous-4/</guid><description>NAL the creator of Mmm and MADDENING for iPhone recently released his newest title Innoqous 4 on PC. It&amp;rsquo;s his first title in 3D and makes Innoquous 4 the best in the gravity-flipping series.
The first thing you&amp;rsquo;ll probably notice is that it is his best looking game yet. Previous NAL games have focused on game play rather than graphics in the past. It also has a very nice soundtrack that blends nicely into the game play.</description></item></channel></rss>

After writing several pro/con lists, I settled on Asus&amp;rsquo; Nexus 7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main reason I decided to go with the Nexus 7 for app development was that it is running the newest version of Android (4.1.1) which is brilliant for testing my app. Being the flagship Google Tablet I expect that it will get all the major revisions of Android almost as they are released.&lt;/p>

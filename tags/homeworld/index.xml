When I played the original Homeworld in 1999 I loved it, even though I could never get past the 6thmission at the time, it’s a game that’s stuck with me since.
This game with the new engine is simply stunning. The visuals are incredible, the cut scenes are re-mastered and the sound quality is excellent.</description></item></channel></rss>

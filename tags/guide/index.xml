One of GameMaker&amp;rsquo;s hidden features is that it has two folders on your computer. The first folder stores the main program that gets overwritten when you update. The second folder is where you can keep all your skins, tutorials, extensions and DnD libraries safe from the evil auto-muncher.
So the folder where the main components of the IDE are is located at</description></item><item><title>Cookie - Surfaces in GameMaker: Studio</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2014-05-31-surfaces-in-gamemaker-studio/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2014 02:25:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2014-05-31-surfaces-in-gamemaker-studio/</guid><description>Getting started with drawing to a surface in GameMaker can be scary, especially when you see all the warnings and mystical properties that are associated with them.
The good news is that in reality, there isn&amp;rsquo;t really that much to them. In the latest release of GameMaker 1.3 the main draw area IS a surface. So you&amp;rsquo;re working with them already, you just don&amp;rsquo;t know it.
The main thing you have to remember about surfaces is they aren&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed to be there, just like biscuits in a biscuit jar, so you have to check they exist before drawing (or eating).</description></item><item><title>Free Website Stumbling</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2011-08-02-free-website-stumbling/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2011 11:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2011-08-02-free-website-stumbling/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I went on an adventure to buy a domain name, rent a server and build my own website. After being with free hosting for the last couple of years, I was fed up with the MySQL database outages and DoS attacks on the servers. So it was finally time to move up to paid hosting. If you ever do want to have a crack at making your own website with a budget of $0 the best hosts/domains from my experience were;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XYfYVy3l6V0/TkJnub0XijI/AAAAAAAAAGg/TWT8scaj3cM/s1600/000Web.gif">&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.000webhost.com/">000webhost&lt;/a> - They are very reliable for a small website, but I did have a lot of trouble with the MySQL server though. They use a custom Cpanel that is very usable, with a couple ads for their parent company on it; your website though will have no ads on it though, which is very nice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AIeMBOxEP5E/TkJnvfe1LoI/AAAAAAAAAGo/vmCz97xvlPk/s1600/x10.jpg">&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.x10hosting.com/">x10hosting&lt;/a> - They have full version of Cpanel 11 and have support for a lot more features than most low paid hosting. The catch is that they have penalties for overusing server resources, which seem unfairly low. The servers were fairly reliable; they did have a little downtime though. And like 000Webhosting, no ads.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Hosting is only half a website though; the other half is getting a domain name. I tried all the popular ones, like co.cc and the ones that x10 and 000 offer. But I managed to find some more decent and professional ones.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

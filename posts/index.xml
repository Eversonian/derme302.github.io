When I played the original Homeworld in 1999 I loved it, even though I could never get past the 6thmission at the time, it’s a game that’s stuck with me since.
This game with the new engine is simply stunning. The visuals are incredible, the cut scenes are re-mastered and the sound quality is excellent.</description></item><item><title>Unicolour</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2014-09-06-unicolour/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2014 16:23:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2014-09-06-unicolour/</guid><description>With the shut down of Twitpic I decided it was time to upload my GIFs somewhere else…all one of them. Unfortunately Twitter doesn't allow GIFs over 3MB, so I had to upload it to YouTube instead, but better than it being lost forever.</description></item><item><title>Mint - Preview of the new 'Blue' Steam UI</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2014-08-13-mint-preview-of-the-new-blue-steam-ui/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2014 02:17:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2014-08-13-mint-preview-of-the-new-blue-steam-ui/</guid><description>The Steam Database posted some mock-ups of what the Steam store will look like with the new theme that is currently in development. Out of curiosity I wanted to know what the whole thing would look like inside the updated client (that is currently available in the beta channel).
All over I think when it's finished it'll be a nice improvement over the current one which is, in my opinion, a little ugly but immeasurably better than what it used to look like.</description></item><item><title>Cookie - Stop GameMaker deleting skins when updating</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2014-06-08-cookie-stop-gamemaker-deleting-skins-when-updating/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2014 08:30:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2014-06-08-cookie-stop-gamemaker-deleting-skins-when-updating/</guid><description>GameMaker's auto-updater has its issues, but deleting your customs skins shouldn't be one of them.
One of GameMaker's hidden features is that it has two folders on your computer. The first folder stores the main program that gets overwritten when you update. The second folder is where you can keep all your skins, tutorials, extensions and DnD libraries safe from the evil auto-muncher.
So the folder where the main components of the IDE are is located at</description></item><item><title>Cookie - Surfaces in GameMaker: Studio</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2014-05-31-surfaces-in-gamemaker-studio/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2014 02:25:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2014-05-31-surfaces-in-gamemaker-studio/</guid><description>Getting started with drawing to a surface in GameMaker can be scary, especially when you see all the warnings and mystical properties that are associated with them.
The good news is that in reality, there isn't really that much to them. In the latest release of GameMaker 1.3 the main draw area IS a surface. So you're working with them already, you just don't know it.
The main thing you have to remember about surfaces is they aren't guaranteed to be there, just like biscuits in a biscuit jar, so you have to check they exist before drawing (or eating).</description></item><item><title>Just 21 - Release</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2014-03-01-just-21-release/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2014 03:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2014-03-01-just-21-release/</guid><description>‘Just 21&amp;rsquo; is a game I started working during the middle of last year as a mobile HTML5 game, however I hit a couple technical difficulties at the time and set the project aside. I recently came back and re-worked the project for Android and iOS. At this stage I'm not planning on releasing a HTML5 version, though it certainly is a possibility for the future.
        When updating the game I thought that by using the existing codebase I wrote last year would help save time, which in hindsight was a mistake.</description></item><item><title>Rotated Hexels!</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2013-11-11-rotated-hexels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2013 14:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2013-11-11-rotated-hexels/</guid><description>So today I finally decided to pick up Hexels, which is a neat little tool to make minimalistic artwork.

Now if you are already bursting with excitement you can skip to the end of the post for a link to the working demo!
The most awesome thing about this extension is that you can still do all your input control, AI and GUI though the GameMaker canvas.</description></item><item><title>Level 19 - Chickens and Moles</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2013-03-05-level-19-chickens-and-moles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2013 23:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2013-03-05-level-19-chickens-and-moles/</guid><description/></item><item><title>GMC Game Jam, GooglePlay, Future Projects</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2013-01-31-gmc-game-jam-googleplay-future-projects/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2013 08:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2013-01-31-gmc-game-jam-googleplay-future-projects/</guid><description>At the start of this week I entered the 9th GameMaker Community Game Jam, my entry wasn't as good as it could of been, in the end I only spent a small amount time working on it. However I had a lot of laughs making it and got some really helpful feedback, which I'll take with me when I go into the next Jam in three months.

When Velociraptor proofing my place of dwelling, something I always wanted to include was a couple of Portal turrets, so I'm really hoping that Valve plan to start selling them on the adjacent self to the Weighted Companion Cubes.

After writing several pro/con lists, I settled on Asus&amp;rsquo; Nexus 7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main reason I decided to go with the Nexus 7 for app development was that it is running the newest version of Android (4.1.1) which is brilliant for testing my app. Being the flagship Google Tablet I expect that it will get all the major revisions of Android almost as they are released.&lt;/p>

The game just never clicked for me, I always found it a bit, dull. Though I will admit I'm a little bit jealous when people go out and build some incredible stuff like a 8-bit computer or a 3d printer.&lt;/p>

After being with free hosting for the last couple of years, I was fed up with the MySQL database outages and DoS attacks on the servers. So it was finally time to move up to paid hosting. If you ever do want to have a crack at making your own website with a budget of $0 the best hosts/domains from my experience were;</description></item><item><title>Make that Game</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2011-06-13-make-that-game/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2011 10:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2011-06-13-make-that-game/</guid><description>When I first discovered the world of programming I wanted to go and make the next Battlefield or Age of Empires, just like the “Getting Started” tutorial warns you against. (Yeah if you missed it, it's right at the top, under the Getting Started heading.)
After failing at that, I lowered my goals to a 2D RTS and a Retro Scrolling Shooter. I still haven't finished either of them. This time it wasn't due to my programming skills, it was because I still hadn't got that message in the “Getting Started” tutorial I had read all those aeons ago.</description></item><item><title>Level 19 - Innoquous 4</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2011-05-16-level-19-innoquous-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2011 09:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2011-05-16-level-19-innoquous-4/</guid><description>NAL the creator of Mmm and MADDENING for iPhone recently released his newest title Innoqous 4 on PC. It's his first title in 3D and makes Innoquous 4 the best in the gravity-flipping series.
The first thing you'll probably notice is that it is his best looking game yet. Previous NAL games have focused on game play rather than graphics in the past. It also has a very nice soundtrack that blends nicely into the game play.</description></item><item><title>Game Maker 8.1 Lite</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2011-04-16-game-maker-8-1-lite-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2011 08:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2011-04-16-game-maker-8-1-lite-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>GameMaker 8.1 (Single word now) has received mixed reviews on the &lt;a href="http://gmc.yoyogames.com/">Game Maker Community&lt;/a>, while a lot of members have given it thumbs up, many are upset that it has broken their code and is not compatible with certain extensions/DLLs. Personally though not only does it run all my games perfectly, it also runs them a lot faster than &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Game Maker&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> 8.0 (Two Words).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/">YoYo Games&lt;/a> made lots of noise about the new zoom feature in the room editor, while this is great (bit buggy though), the big thing new feature for me has to be the upgraded font rendering! Now all my games have sharp as crystal text. When Mike Dailly first brought up the whole font improvement, I just didn't get it, I couldn't even tell the difference between the two images he put up comparing the new and the old. But now I get it and I am going to rush out and buy the standard edition tomorrow (Literally).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Howdy!</title><link>https://derme.coffee/posts/2011-04-14-howdy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2011 06:22:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://derme.coffee/posts/2011-04-14-howdy/</guid><description>Its been a while, hasn't it? I've tried to do a blog a few times now, but haven't been able to keep it going. So here goes attempt three!
Alright, onto the good stuff, other than this blog I've been busy working on a very cool new game. It's still early days, but it's shaping up to be interesting.
Currently in the process of increasing the graphics quality, something that was severely lacking in the last game.</description></item></channel></rss>

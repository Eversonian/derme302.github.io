So this makes you life much easier when your trouble shooting.</p><p>Indenting code with the TAB key really makes it that much quicker to indent a selection of code, a feature which is just awesome.</p><p>Finally the new zoom function in the room editor, while one of the more noticeable changes they have made to GameMaker, I really didn't feel that excited about it. However now that I have used it, I'll never go back to GM 8.0.</p><p>So that’s it for GM Lite, overall I'd give it 4.5/5 Neurons, while it has improved GameMaker greatly , the release felt “rushed” and there was a couple of really obvious bugs. I sure though with the new Auto-Updater these errors will be fixed over the coming days.</p><p>Till next time folks!</p><p>Photo (GameMaker 8.1): <a href=http://glog.yoyogames.com/>YoYoGames Glog</a></p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=/posts/2011-04-14-howdy/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i><span class=navigation-tittle>Howdy!</span></a>

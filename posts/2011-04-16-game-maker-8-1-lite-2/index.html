But now I get it and I am going to rush out and buy the standard edition tomorrow (Literally).</p><p>The second thing that I was personally looking forward to was the ability to name execute code statements. Like this:</p><p><img src=/uploads/2011/04/GM_Script.png alt="GameMaker Script Icon"> Execute a piece of code</p><p><strong>Becomes</strong></p><p><img src=/uploads/2011/04/GM_Script.png alt="GameMaker Script Icon">Draw Menu</p><p>Simply by adding a single comment line at the start of the code.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-cpp data-lang=cpp><span style=color:#998;font-style:italic>///Draw the menu
</span><span style=color:#998;font-style:italic>//rest of your code here
</span></code></pre></div><p>Cool, Huh? So this makes you life much easier when your trouble shooting.</p><p>Indenting code with the TAB key really makes it that much quicker to indent a selection of code, a feature which is just awesome.</p><p>Finally the new zoom function in the room editor, while one of the more noticeable changes they have made to GameMaker, I really didn&rsquo;t feel that excited about it. However now that I have used it, I&rsquo;ll never go back to GM 8.0.</p><p>So that’s it for GM Lite, overall I&rsquo;d give it 4.5/5 Neurons, while it has improved GameMaker greatly , the release felt “rushed” and there was a couple of really obvious bugs. I sure though with the new Auto-Updater these errors will be fixed over the coming days.</p><p>Till next time folks!</p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=/posts/2011-04-14-howdy/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i><span class=navigation-tittle>Howdy!</span></a>

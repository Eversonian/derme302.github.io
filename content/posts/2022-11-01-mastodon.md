If you have managed to avoid the news eruption about [Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23184519/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-deal-complete-agreement) and the flow of discussion about what that means for the future of Twitter:

I think Elon has done some great things over the years, however I find the idea of Twitter being a private company very concerning. I've also realised that Twitter isn't the same platform I joined in 2009.

After researching [how to get started with Mastodon](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/7/15183128/mastodon-open-source-twitter-clone-how-to-use). I set myself up on [mastodon.gamedev.place](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/about), which was created by [Aras Pranckeviƒçius](https://aras-p.info/) one of the original Unity developers. It seems like a nice place with some great game development discussion, Twitter these days goes off-topic far too often.

You can find me at [mastodon.gamedev.place/web/@derme302](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/web/@derme302), look forward to seeing you there!

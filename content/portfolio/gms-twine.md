The Twine extension allows you to use [Twine](https://twinery.org/) non-linear stories in GameMaker. This is deprecated and should only be used if you need Twine support. [Chatterbox](https://github.com/JujuAdams/Chatterbox)(GameMaker implementation of [Yarn](https://yarnspinner.dev/)) is a much better extension for non-linear story games.
